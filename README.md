## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust data engineering framework that consolidates, organizes, and provides easy access to a wide range of financial professional development resources, which will cater in the future to aid a curated learning experience.

## Project Goals
This project is designed to leverage advanced data engineering techniques for the aggregation and structuring of finance professional development materials. Our approach is methodical and spans four critical phases:

1. Web Scraping and Dataset Creation:
   - Employ web scraping technologies, such as Beautiful Soup or Scrapy, to systematically gather data from selected webpages, starting with the CFA Instituteâ€™s site. This involves dynamically navigating from the main page to individual articles, focusing on extracting key information including introductions, learning outcomes, and summaries.
   - The data collected will be structured into a coherent CSV dataset featuring columns for the topic name, publication year, level, introduction summary, learning outcomes, and direct links to both the summary page and associated PDF files.
   - A Python notebook will be developed to automate and document this process for repeatability and scalability.

2. PDF Extraction:
   - Utilize tools like PyPDF2 and Grobid for text extraction from PDF documents to capture detailed topic outlines.
   - Output will be systematically organized into text files, adhering to a specific naming convention, and sorted into designated folders for efficient access and reference.
   - Another Python notebook will be created to streamline this extraction workflow.

3. Database Integration:
   - With SQLAlchemy, the structured data from the initial scraping phase will be uploaded to a Snowflake database, ensuring that our collected data is securely stored and easily accessible for analysis and querying.
   - Detailed documentation of this upload process will be provided through a dedicated Python notebook.

4. Cloud Storage and Database Metadata Management:
   - A Python function will be crafted for the seamless upload of all gathered data (both CSV datasets and extracted text files) to an AWS S3 bucket, ensuring our data is backed up and stored in a scalable, cloud-based environment.
   - Additionally, metadata extracted in the PDF phase will be uploaded to the Snowflake database using SQLAlchemy, with the process thoroughly documented in a Python notebook for transparency and ease of understanding.

## Data Sources
The data sources utilized in this assignment are as follows:

1. CFA Instituteâ€™s Website: The primary source for extracting finance professional development    materials, including introductions, learning outcomes, and summaries of various topics.

2. PDF Documents: These documents are Accessed through direct links on the CFA Institute's website and provide in-depth outlines and detailed content on specific finance-related topics.

These sources are pivotal for creating a rich dataset and extracting valuable insights for the finance professional community.


## Pre-requisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate your project's environment from other Python projects. You can create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` or `venv`.
- **requirements.txt**: Install the required Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Config File**: Set up the `configurations.properties` file with the necessary credentials and configurations.
- **Docker**: Docker setup is required for running the Grobid server.
- **Graphviz**: Graphviz is needed for generating the architecture diagram. If you're using macOS, you can install it via Homebrew: `brew install graphviz`. For Windows users, you can install it using Chocolatey: `choco install graphviz`.
- **AWS S3**: Set up an IAM user with appropriate permissions for accessing S3 buckets. Ensure you have the necessary access keys and secrets configured in your AWS CLI or SDK. 
- **Snowflake**: Create a Snowflake warehouse, database, and schema. Ensure you have the necessary credentials and configurations set up in the `configurations.properties` file for connecting to Snowflake.
